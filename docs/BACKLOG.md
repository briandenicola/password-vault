# Password Vault — Improvement Backlog

> Context: this is a self-hosted password vault used by one family. The goal is
> **"secure and maintainable, with a clean migration path from the current data"** —
> not NSA-proof. Items are prioritized for real-world family risk, with effort
> estimates (S = hours, M = a day or two, L = several days). Nothing here is
> meant as criticism of the original — it has served its purpose; this is the
> punch list to take it to the next level.

Legend — Priority: **P0** do first / **P1** soon / **P2** nice-to-have / **P3** polish.

> **Progress (branch `improvements/security-and-features-backlog`):** Phase 0 started —
> ✅ `CR-1` (UTF-8 crypto fix + regression tests), ✅ `EN-1` (gitignore conflict),
> ✅ `EN-2` (xUnit test project), ✅ **.NET 10 upgrade** (API + devcontainer + docs),
> ✅ `EN-3`/`CD-1` (CI workflow), ✅ `MIG-1` (versioned ciphertext format),
> ✅ `CR-2`/`CR-3`/`CR-4`/`CR-5`/`CR-6` (AES-GCM `v2` writes + HKDF key separation + instance-state fix),
> ✅ `MIG-2`/`MIG-3` (`vault-migrate` tool: backup, verify, dry-run/apply re-encryption v1→v2),
> ✅ `FE-13` (password history UI), ✅ `AC-1` (server-side Entra token validation), ✅ `AC-2` (Anonymous triggers + fail-closed auth; browser function key dropped),
> ✅ `GE-1`/`GE-2`/`GE-3`/`GE-4`/`UI-5` (generator overhaul: options, exclude-ambiguous, passphrase mode, unbiased sampling + Vitest),
> ✅ `FE-15` (per-user settings page: generator + vault-list defaults, localStorage store),
> ✅ `UI-1`/`UI-2` (clipboard auto-clear + idle auto-lock, settings-driven),
> ✅ `UI-3`/`UI-6` (MSAL bootstrap rewrite + `@azure/msal-browser` v2→v5 upgrade),
> ✅ `UI-4` (PrimeVue v4 migration; removed `@vue/compat` + `bootstrap-vue`, now Vue 3-native),
> ✅ `FE-4` (reused/duplicate-password Security Audit page),
> ✅ `FE-1` (live password strength meter on create/update),
> ✅ `FE-2` (tags + search across account/site/notes/tags + tag filter),
> ✅ `FE-5` (password-age reminders: age label + stale "Old" badge, configurable threshold),
> ✅ `FE-6` (recycle bin: view + restore soft-deleted accounts),
> ✅ `FE-3` (HaveIBeenPwned breach check via k-anonymity; no secret leaves the client),
> ✅ `FE-8` (CSV import/export with header mapping for Bitwarden/Chrome/1Password).
> New writes are now AES-GCM; legacy `v1` still reads, and existing data can be migrated with `vault-migrate`.
> Design for `OFF-4` in [`design/e2ee.md`](design/e2ee.md); decision recorded in [ADR-0008](adr/0008-client-side-e2ee-passkey-prf.md); PRF spike validated on devices.

## Theme 1 — Cryptography correctness (data integrity)

These protect the actual passwords. Two are genuine "you can silently lose or
weaken data" bugs, so they come first.

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| CR-1 | **P0** | S | ✅ **Done (via CR-2 rewrite).** **ASCII vs UTF-8 mismatch fixed.** `Encryption.cs` now uses `Encoding.UTF8` on both the encrypt and decrypt paths (legacy v1 and v2), so `é`, `£`, emoji, etc. round-trip correctly. *Note: entries written before this fix with non-ASCII chars were already corrupted to `?` and are unrecoverable — see `MIG-1`.* |
| CR-2 | **P1** | M | ✅ **Done.** **Authenticated encryption (AES-GCM).** New writes use `AesGcm` (random 96-bit nonce/entry, tag verified before decrypt → returns null on tamper). Stored as `v2.gcm.<iv>.<ct+tag>` via `SecretEnvelope`. `Encryptor.DecryptStored` routes v1/v2 so legacy data still reads. Encrypt now goes through `EncryptGcm`. |
| CR-3 | **P1** | S | ✅ **Done (via CR-2).** v2 no longer MACs the plaintext, so identical passwords no longer produce identical stored output (random nonce). Legacy v1 retains the flaw until `MIG-2` re-encrypts. |
| CR-4 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done (via CR-2).** AES-GCM uses a fresh random 96-bit nonce per entry; the static env `AesIV` is now only used by the legacy v1 decrypt path. |
| CR-5 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done for v2.** The GCM key is HKDF-SHA256-derived from the configured key (`info="passwordvault:v2:gcm"`), so it never shares material with the legacy AES/HMAC usage. |
| CR-6 | P3 | S | ✅ **Done.** `Encryptor`'s `_key`/`_iv` were `static` — the last-constructed instance overwrote the key process-wide (a real DI bug; surfaced as a parallel-test race). Now instance fields. |

## Theme 2 — Access control & secrets

The biggest *practical* exposure: the API trusts a shared key, and that key is
shipped to the browser.

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| AC-1 | **P0** | M | ✅ **Done.** **Validate the Entra ID token in the API.** Added isolated-worker JWT middleware (`Common/JwtAuthenticationMiddleware.cs`) that validates issuer/audience/signature/lifetime against Entra's OIDC metadata, with an optional `oid` allowlist. Security-critical logic is in the pure, unit-tested `Common/EntraTokenAuth.cs` (`EntraTokenValidator`, incl. wrong-key/issuer/audience/expired/allowlist). `AUTH_ENABLED` is fail-closed: it defaults on via `app_requires_authentication`, and protected endpoints return 401 until required Entra tenant/audience settings are present. Health check stays anonymous. Env/runbook in [`entra.md`](entra.md). |
| AC-2 | **P0** | S | ✅ **Done (code; live cutover is operator-run).** **Stop shipping the function key to the browser.** All HTTP triggers flipped `Function`→`Anonymous`, so the AC-1 JWT middleware is the sole guard — and it's now **fail-closed**: `AUTH_ENABLED` defaults ON and only the explicit string `false` disables it (local/offline dev), so a misconfigured deploy denies (401) rather than exposing the API. The SPA no longer sends `x-functions-key` (`main.js`), the leaked key was removed from `ui/.env`, and the GitHub Actions UI deployment no longer writes `VUE_APP_API_KEY`. Terraform `app_requires_authentication` now defaults `true`. Regression coverage: fail-closed option tests (unset/empty/`true`→enabled; only `false`→disabled) + headless smoke proving no function-key header is sent. **Operator still runs the live cutover** (configure AAD → deploy → **rotate the old host key**) per the [`entra.md`](entra.md) runbook. |
| AC-3 | P2 | M | 🚫 **Not planned.** **Scope data to the authenticated user.** All records share one env partition key. Owner decision: the vault is a single shared family vault by design — nothing is hidden between family members — so per-user partitioning isn't wanted. (If selective *sharing* is ever desired, see `FE-10`.) See [ADR-0006](adr/0006-single-shared-family-vault.md). |
| AC-4 | P1 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Removed sensitive log line.** `PostPassword` no longer logs the stored password blob — it logs only `id`. A source-scanning regression guard (`SensitiveLoggingTests`) fails CI if any HTTP trigger logs a password/secret field, so this can't silently come back. |

## Theme 3 — Migration from the existing vault (explicitly requested)

You want to move existing data onto the improved scheme without losing it.

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| MIG-1 | **P0** | M | ✅ **Done.** **Versioned ciphertext format.** Introduced `Common/SecretEnvelope.cs`: a version-aware parse/serialize for stored blobs. Legacy `hmac:ciphertext` is recognized as `v1` (no rewrite of existing data needed); the `v2.gcm.<iv>.<ct+tag>` format is parsed/serialized and ready for `CR-2`. Discriminator: legacy base64 never contains `.`, versioned blobs always do. `PasswordEntity` now delegates to the envelope and exposes `Format`. 14 regression tests (incl. real-Encryptor v1 round-trip, non-ASCII/emoji, malformed→`FormatException`). No crypto changed yet. |
| MIG-2 | **P0** | M | ✅ **Done.** **One-time re-encryption migration.** `src/passwordapp.tools` (`vault-migrate`): reuses the production `Encryptor`/`DocumentMigrator` (no second crypto impl) to read each Cosmos doc, decrypt legacy `v1`, re-encrypt to `v2` (AES-GCM), **verify the round-trip**, and upsert. Dry-run by default; `--apply` to write; idempotent (skips `v2`); refuses to write any doc whose secrets didn't all migrate+verify. Backs up first. Tasks: `migrate:dryrun`/`migrate:apply`. Core covered by unit tests (`VaultMigrationTests`, `DocumentMigratorTests`). |
| MIG-3 | P1 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Pre-migration backup + verify.** `vault-migrate backup` snapshots every doc to JSON; `vault-migrate verify` decrypt-checks every secret (current + history) and reports undecryptable entries (`migrate:backup`/`migrate:verify`). Also hardened the legacy `Decrypt` to fail safe (return null) instead of throwing on corrupt input, so a bad entry can't crash a bulk pass. *Caveat documented: CR-1-mangled non-ASCII still decrypts and can't be auto-detected — review known accented/emoji accounts manually.* |
| MIG-4 | P2 | M–L | ✅ **Done (code; operator runs the one-shot at cutover).** **Import / transform into a new E2EE-native store.** `Common/BlueGreenVaultTransformer.cs` (pure, Cosmos-free) + `vault-migrate import`: read a `backup` JSON snapshot → **decrypt** each current + historical secret with the existing `Encryptor` (no second crypto impl) → **re-encrypt under the supplied vault DEK** (`v2.gcm`) → write the new schema (DEK-encrypted blobs; legacy `HmacHash` dropped). Verifies each transformed blob round-trips, idempotent, refuses partial docs; plaintext stays in memory only (DEK via `VAULT_DEK_BASE64`/`--dek-base64`). Unit-tested (links into `passwordapp.api.tests`; 126 API tests green). Design: [`design/blue-green-rebuild.md`](design/blue-green-rebuild.md) §3–4. |
| MIG-5 | P2 | S–M | ✅ **Done (code; run before each flip).** **Cutover parity verification.** `BlueGreenVaultTransformer.VerifyParity` + `vault-migrate verify-parity`: account + per-account history **count parity** old→new and **value parity** (`decrypt_new == decrypt_old`) for every entry; flags missing/extra/duplicate ids and any undecryptable entry; non-zero exit on any failure. Spot-check known `CR-1` non-ASCII by hand. *(Honors "no hopeful patches" — proves the exact migration path.)* Design: [`design/blue-green-rebuild.md`](design/blue-green-rebuild.md) §6. |

## Theme 4 — Front-end UX & safety

Quality-of-life and "don't leave secrets lying around" items for a family tool.

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| UI-1 | P1 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Auto-clear clipboard.** `copyWithAutoClear` (`utils/clipboard.js`) writes the secret then overwrites the clipboard after a configurable delay (default 30s; 0 = off). `home.js` `copyText`/`copyPassword` use it and surface the countdown in the success message. Delay is driven by `FE-15` settings (`security.clipboardClearSeconds`). Vitest-covered. |
| UI-2 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Auto-lock / re-auth timeout.** `IdleTimer` (`utils/idle-timer.js`) + throttled activity listeners in `App.vue` fire after the configured idle period (default 5m; 0 = off, `security.autoLockMinutes`), dropping in-memory plaintext via a forced sign-out (or reload when auth is disabled) so re-auth is required. Vitest-covered. |
| UI-3 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done.** **Fix MSAL bootstrap + token storage.** Rewrote `AzureAD.Authentication.js` to memoize a single awaited init (`initialize()` → `handleRedirectPromise()` → set active account) so the app no longer mounts/guards before the account is known. `main.js` awaits init and only sends `Authorization` when authenticated (no more `Bearer null`); the router guard awaits init before checking auth. Vitest-covered (8 tests). (Token cache still `localStorage` for SSO continuity — `sessionStorage`/passkey hardening tracked with `OFF-4`/E2EE.) |
| UI-4 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done.** **Migrated UI library to PrimeVue v4 + exited Vue 2 compat.** Removed `@vue/compat` (compat MODE 2) and `bootstrap-vue@2` (which dragged EOL `vue@2.7.16`); `npm ls vue` now shows only `vue@3`. Added `primevue@4` + `@primevue/themes` (Aura preset) + `primeicons`; registered components globally in `main.js` (moved off the Vue-2 global `Vue.use/component` API to the app instance). Ported all screens — `b-table`→**DataTable** (sort incl. last-modified, built-in paginator, row-expansion via `v-model:expandedRows`, responsive stack), `b-modal`+`$refs.show()`→**Dialog** with `v-model:visible`, plus InputText/Textarea/Select/Checkbox/RadioButton/Tag/Message/Button. Replaced Vue-2 `$set` with native reactivity. Kept Bootstrap **CSS** (framework-agnostic utilities, BS5) for grid/spacing to avoid a high-risk layout rewrite. Validated with a headless (Puppeteer) smoke pass over home/create/update/settings: all mount with zero page errors, generator + DataTable + reveal/history/delete Dialogs all exercised. (Caught & fixed two browser-only bugs en route: a `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` unbound-`this` "Illegal invocation" in the UI-1/UI-2 timers, and an unhandled `handleRedirectPromise` rejection that blocked app mount.) |
| UI-6 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done.** **Upgrade `@azure/msal-browser` v2 → v5.** Bumped `^2.39.0` → `^5.15.0`. Adopted the v5 contract: mandatory awaited `initialize()`, active-account model (`setActiveAccount`/`getActiveAccount`), and account-gated `acquireTokenSilent` with `acquireTokenRedirect` fallback on `InteractionRequiredAuthError`. Done together with `UI-3` (single auth-module rewrite); build green and vendor bundle slightly smaller. |
| UI-5 | P3 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Improve the existing generator.** Rewrote the generator as a pure, unit-tested module (`utils/generator.js`) backing a reusable `PasswordGenerator` component, delivering `GE-1`/`GE-2`/`GE-3`/`GE-4` (configurable options, exclude-ambiguous, passphrase mode, unbiased sampling) plus a live strength/entropy readout. `utils.js` keeps a backward-compatible `generatePassword()`. Vitest added; tests run in CI. (Generator defaults will later be driven by `FE-15` settings.) |

### UI-4 migration steps (bootstrap-vue@2 → PrimeVue v4)

1. **Inventory current usage.** Grep the UI for `b-*` components/directives (`b-form*`, `b-button`, `b-modal`, `b-table`, `b-nav*`, etc.) and `v-b-*` directives to size the surface and build a component map.
2. **Add PrimeVue, stage the swap.** `npm install primevue` (+ an icon set, e.g. `primeicons`); register it in `main.js` (`app.use(PrimeVue, { theme: ... })`) and import a theme/preset. Keep bootstrap-vue installed during the transition so the app stays runnable.
3. **Port screen-by-screen.** Replace components per the map — e.g. `b-form-input`→`InputText`, `b-form-group`→label + `<small>`, `b-button`→`Button`, `b-modal`→`Dialog`, `b-form-select`→`Select`, nav→`Menubar`. Do one route at a time (home → create → update → notfound) and smoke-test each.
4. **Adopt the built-in `Password` component.** Use `<Password feedback toggleMask>` on the create/update password fields to deliver the FE-1 strength meter; wire the existing generator into its input.
5. **Drop Bootstrap + compat.** Remove `bootstrap-vue`, `bootstrap`, `portal-vue`, and `@vue/compat`; delete Bootstrap CSS imports and the `compat` Vite/alias config; replace residual layout/grid utilities (PrimeFlex or plain CSS).
6. **Verify.** `npm ls vue` shows only `vue@3` (no `2.7.16`); `npm run build` is clean; manual pass over all four screens + copy/reveal/generate flows. CI (`ui` job) gates the build.

> Sequence note: do UI-4 **before** UI-6 (MSAL) so you're testing one big dependency change at a time; both are P2/Theme 4.

## Theme 5 — Infrastructure hardening

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| IN-1 | P2 | S | **Key Vault purge protection.** `keyvault.tf:7-9` has `purge_protection_enabled = false`; enable it so key/connection-string secrets survive accidental purge. |
| IN-2 | P2 | M | **Cosmos + Functions via Managed Identity/RBAC** instead of connection-string/function keys (`cosmosdb.tf`, `functions.tf`). |
| IN-3 | P3 | M | **Restrict public network access.** `functions.tf` runs `public_network_access_enabled = true`. Consider IP allow-list or Private Endpoint (weigh against family-from-anywhere convenience). |
| IN-4 | P3 | S | **Remote Terraform state.** Backend is commented out in `providers.tf` (local state). Move to a remote backend. |
| IN-5 | P3 | S | **Confirm SWA auth enforcement.** `staticwebapp.tf` defines no auth; enforcement currently relies on client routing. |

## Theme 6 — Engineering hygiene

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| EN-1 | **P1** | S | **Resolve `.gitignore` merge conflict.** Lines ~330/375 still contain `<<<<<<< HEAD` / `=======` markers, so ignore rules below them are unreliable. |
| EN-2 | P1 | M | **Add automated tests.** No unit tests exist (only manual `scripts/test-*.ps1`). Start with round-trip crypto tests (covers CR-1/CR-2 regressions) and the migration job. |
| EN-3 | P2 | M | **Add CI.** No `.github/workflows`. Add build + test + (optionally) deploy on PR. |
| EN-4 | P3 | S | **Meaningful commit messages.** Recent history is emoji-only; low signal for future debugging. |

---

## Suggested sequencing (a kind, realistic path)

1. **Stop the bleeding (P0, ~2–3 days):** CR-1 (UTF-8), MIG-1 + MIG-3 (versioning + backup/verify), AC-1 + AC-2 (real auth, drop browser key).
2. **Strengthen the core (P1):** CR-2/CR-3 (AES-GCM) → MIG-2 (re-encrypt), AC-4 (log scrub), EN-1/EN-2 (gitignore + crypto tests), UI-1 (clipboard clear).
3. **Harden & modernize (P2):** AC-3, UI-2/UI-3, IN-1/IN-2, EN-3.
4. **Polish (P3):** UI-4/UI-5, IN-3/IN-4/IN-5, CR-6, EN-4.

> Do CR-1 and MIG-3 *together first*: fix the UTF-8 bug, then run a verify pass so
> any already-corrupted non-ASCII passwords are surfaced and re-entered by hand
> rather than carried forward into the new scheme.

## Theme 7 — Feature ideas

Realistic, family-friendly features. Most are independent of the security work;
a few (marked) are easier *after* end-to-end encryption (see Theme 8).

### Generator improvements (the existing one is good — polish it)

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| GE-1 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Configurable options in the UI.** New reusable `PasswordGenerator` component (`components/generator/`) with a length slider (8–64) and upper/lower/digit/symbol toggles, embedded on create + update. Live entropy/strength readout. |
| GE-2 | P3 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Exclude-ambiguous mode.** Toggle removes visually confusable chars (`O/0/o/i/I/l/L/1/|` and quotes) from the pool; entropy estimate accounts for the smaller pool. |
| GE-3 | P3 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Passphrase / diceware mode.** Mode toggle generates word-list passphrases from the bundled **EFF large wordlist** (7776 words, CC-BY, `utils/wordlist.js`) with configurable word count, separator, capitalize, and optional number (~12.9 bits/word). |
| GE-4 | P3 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Remove modulo bias.** Replaced `% charset.length` with `secureRandomBelow()` rejection sampling (used for both char selection and the Fisher-Yates shuffle). Unit-tested incl. the rejection path + statistical uniformity. |

### Vault features

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| FE-1 | P1 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Strength meter on create/update.** Live strength meter under the password field on both the create and update forms. Pure, unit-tested estimator in `components/utils/strength.js` (`estimatePasswordStrength`): entropy from charset pool size × length, reusing the generator's Weak/Fair/Strong/Excellent thresholds (40/60/80 bits), plus a `COMMON_PASSWORDS` blocklist and repeat/sequence detection that force a **Very weak** rating with a warning regardless of length. Reusable `strength/strength-meter.vue` (bar + Tag + bits + warning). Dependency-free (no zxcvbn). 15 Vitest tests + headless smoke-validated (live updates, common-password flagged, hidden when empty). |
| FE-2 | P1 | M | ✅ **Done.** **Search / filter / tags.** Each entry now carries optional `Tags` (`AccountPassword.Tags`, copied in `Clone()`, persisted by Post/Update). Create/Update forms have a comma-separated tags field (pure, tested `utils/tags.js`: `parseTags`/`formatTags`/`collectTags`/`hasTag` — trim, dedupe case-insensitively). The vault list shows clickable tag chips per row, a **tag filter** Select (built from `collectTags`), and the substring search now also matches **notes and tags** (not just account/site). 11 Vitest tests + 4 API tests (Clone/JSON round-trip) + headless smoke-validated (chips render, finance filter narrows 3→1). |
| FE-3 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done.** **Breach check (HaveIBeenPwned).** A second tool on the **Security Audit** page checks each password against HIBP's Pwned Passwords range API using **k-anonymity** — only the first 5 chars of each password's SHA-1 hash leave the device; the password and full hash never do. Pure, tested `audit/hibp.js` (`sha1Hex` via Web Crypto, `parsePwnedRange`, `pwnedCount` with injectable fetch). Native `fetch` (bypasses the Axios API baseURL) with the `Add-Padding` header; passwords deduped to minimise calls; breached accounts listed with their breach count and a **Change** action; plaintext dropped right after. 11 Vitest tests + headless smoke (reused→99,999 flagged, safe account excluded, only 5-char prefixes sent). |
| FE-4 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Reused / duplicate password report.** New `/audit` route + **Security Audit** page (linked from the vault nav). Pure, unit-tested grouping logic in `components/audit/reuse.js` (`findReusedPasswords`/`countReusedAccounts`); the page fetches each entry's server-decrypted password (the list returns only encrypted blobs, and AES-GCM gives identical passwords different ciphertext), groups accounts sharing a password, and lists each group with a **Change** action (→ Update page, where the generator lives). Plaintext is dropped right after grouping and never enters reactive state / the DOM. 10 Vitest tests + headless smoke-validated. |
| FE-5 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Password age / expiry reminders.** Pure, tested `utils/age.js` (`daysSince`/`monthsSince`/`isStale`/`ageLabel`, injectable "now"). The vault list shows a human age ("3 months", "2 years") under **Last Modified** and an **Old** warning Tag (with tooltip) when an entry is older than the configurable threshold. Threshold lives in settings (`list.staleAfterMonths`, default 24 months; **Never**/6mo/1/2/3yr choices on the Settings page). 15 Vitest tests + headless smoke-validated (only the 1200-day entry flagged). |
| FE-6 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done.** **Recycle bin / restore.** Soft-delete already set `isDeleted=true`; now there's a **Recycle Bin** page (`/trash`, linked from the vault nav) to view and recover deleted accounts. New API endpoints: `GET passwords/deleted` (lists soft-deleted entries; literal route beats `{id}`) and `POST passwords/{id}/restore` (clears `isDeleted`, bumps `LastModifiedDate`, upserts via the Cosmos output binding). `Password.Service.js` gains `getDeleted()`/`restore(id)`; the page lists account/site/deleted-date with a per-row **Restore** action that removes the row and confirms. Headless smoke-validated (lists 2 deleted, restore POSTs the right id, row clears). *Note:* this is recovery only — there's no hard "empty trash" yet (the Cosmos output binding upserts, so a true purge needs the Cosmos SDK; tracked as a follow-up). |
| FE-7 | P2 | M | 🚫 **Not planned.** **TOTP (2FA) secret storage + code generation.** Technically low-risk (RFC 6238 via Web Crypto HMAC-SHA1), but it stores a *second* factor next to the first under today's server-trust model. Deferred by owner decision; revisit once `OFF-4` (E2EE) lands so the seed can be encrypted client-side and the server never holds both factors. |
| FE-8 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done (CSV).** **Import / export.** New **Import / Export** page (`/transfer`, linked from the vault nav). **Export** downloads every account to a CSV (`name,url,username,password,notes,tags`) that re-imports here and into browsers/most managers — with a clear plain-text warning. **Import** reads a CSV, maps headers case-insensitively (our export + Bitwarden `login_*`/`folder`, Chrome `name/url/username/note`, 1Password), previews the rows (skipping any missing account/site/password), then creates each via the API. Pure, tested `transfer/csv.js` (RFC-4180 `parseCsv`/`toCsv`, `entriesToCsv`, `csvToEntries`) — 15 Vitest tests (quoting/escaping, embedded commas/newlines, Bitwarden/Chrome header mapping, skip-count, round-trip) + headless smoke (export quoting + dated filename; import previews 2, skips 1, posts correct fields). Native JSON backup + other-manager formats can follow. |
| FE-9 | P3 | M | **Secure notes / attachments.** Free-form encrypted notes or small files (e.g. recovery codes, passport scans). |
| FE-10 | P3 | L | **Per-item / shared-folder sharing.** Selective sharing instead of one shared vault (depends on AC-3 user scoping). |
| FE-11 | P3 | M | **Biometric / WebAuthn app unlock.** Use platform authenticator to unlock the app locally. |
| FE-12 | P3 | S | **Backup/restore UI.** A `scripts/decrypt-backup.py` exists as a CLI; expose backup/export from the UI. |
| FE-13 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Password history view (UI).** Added `getHistory(id)` to `Password.Service.js` (calls `passwords/{id}/history`) and a history modal in `home.vue`/`home.js`: a per-account table of every password (current + prior) with timestamps, a **Current** badge on the newest, and a per-row copy button. Reachable from a new clock action in the account row. (Built on bootstrap-vue for now; will carry over in the UI-4 PrimeVue migration.) |
| FE-14 | P3 | M | **Better sorting / filtering / searching.** Builds on `FE-2`. Today the home list uses bootstrap-vue's `b-table` with sort on Account/Site only (`lastModifiedDate` is `sortable: false`) and a single substring filter (`home.js:19-24`). Improvements: make every column sortable (incl. last-modified/age), add scoped filters (by site/account/tag/folder once `FE-2` lands), and a faster global search. **Couples to `UI-4`:** the PrimeVue migration replaces `b-table` with PrimeVue `DataTable`, which provides column sort, per-column filters, and global search out of the box — so do this as part of / after `UI-4`. |
| FE-15 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done (v1).** **User settings / preferences page.** New `/settings` route + page (linked from the vault nav) backed by a per-user `localStorage` store (`components/settings/settings.store.js`) with deep-merge defaults, forward-compat backfill, type-checking, and corrupt-JSON fallback. Today it controls **generator defaults** (password/passphrase mode + all options — the `PasswordGenerator` seeds from it) and **vault list defaults** (sort field/direction, rows per page — `home.js` seeds from it). The store schema is the single source of truth and is ready to grow into `UI-1` (clipboard auto-clear), `UI-2` (auto-lock), theme, and a server-stored profile after `AC-3`. Vitest-covered (10 tests). |

## Theme 8 — Offline caching (answering "how hard would it be?")

Short answer: it's a **spectrum**, and the app already does the easy part. The
catch is the current architecture **decrypts on the server**, so true offline
access to secrets requires moving decryption to the client first.

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item & difficulty notes |
|----|-----|--------|--------------------------|
| OFF-1 | P3 | ✅ **Done (app-shell)** | **Installable PWA + app-shell offline.** Hardened the existing PWA so it's a great phone experience: fixed the broken `manifest.json` (it referenced 512/maskable icons that didn't exist and used a black splash) by moving config to `manifestOptions` with a full icon set (192/512 `any` + `maskable`), navy splash (`background_color #343541`), `description`/`id`/`scope`/`orientation`/`categories`; generated a real icon set (512, maskable 192/512, 180px iOS `apple-touch-icon`, `favicon.ico`). Added an in-app **update prompt** (`components/pwa/`): the SW waits and a banner lets the user pick up the new version (posts `SKIP_WAITING`). The SW precaches only the app shell — the cross-origin Functions API (vault data) is **never** cached. Regression coverage: `sw-update.spec.js` (skip-waiting + reload-once guard) + headless smoke (SW active, manifest/all icons 200, banner→`SKIP_WAITING`). Remaining: an explicit "you're offline" data state belongs to OFF-2/OFF-4 (needs client-side data). |
| OFF-2 | P2 | **M–L** | **Read-only offline vault.** Cache entries in IndexedDB so the family can *view* passwords with no signal. **The blocker:** today `GetPasswordById` decrypts server-side and returns plaintext, so caching would mean storing plaintext (or the function key) in the browser — unacceptable. The clean path is to cache **encrypted** blobs and decrypt in the browser, which requires E2EE (OFF-4). Effort is M if you accept caching encrypted blobs + client decrypt; L if done carefully with key handling and auto-lock. |
| OFF-3 | P3 | **L** | **Offline edits + sync.** Queue create/update/delete while offline and replay on reconnect, with conflict resolution (last-write-wins is simplest given low family concurrency). Genuinely the hardest piece; only worth it if OFF-2 proves valuable. |
| OFF-4 | P2 | **L (enabler)** | **End-to-end / zero-knowledge encryption.** ✅ *Design decided* — see [`design/e2ee.md`](design/e2ee.md). Password-free unlock via **WebAuthn passkey PRF**; envelope model (random vault DEK wrapped per passkey via a PRF-derived KEK, all in Web Crypto); Entra for sign-in only. The server never sees plaintext or the key. Unlocks OFF-2/OFF-3 and FE-3/FE-4. Pairs with Theme 1 AES-GCM + Theme 3 versioned/migration format. PRF feasibility validated via `scripts/spikes/webauthn-prf`. **Progress:** ✅ *Phase 1* — flag-gated client crypto foundation (`ui/src/components/crypto/*`: AES-GCM `v2.gcm` envelope, DEK gen/wrap, HKDF KEK, recovery key, §5B record, passkey PRF helpers; 38 tests). ✅ *Phase 2a* — server **vault-key store**: flag-gated (`E2EE_ENABLED`, default off) `GET`/`PUT /api/vault-key` persisting the §5B record (PRF salt + wrapped DEKs) in an isolated Cosmos container; pure `VaultKeyRecordValidator`/`E2eeFeature` (30 tests). Server stores it opaquely — cannot unwrap. ✅ *Phase 2b* — in-memory **DEK session** (`ui/src/components/crypto/vault-session.js`): the unwrapped DEK lives in module memory only (never persisted), with `unlock`/`lock`/`getDek`/`subscribe` + idle auto-lock; App.vue's idle lock now clears it (13 tests). *Next:* on-device passkey enrollment/unlock validation (owner hardware), then 2d MIG-2/MIG-3 client-driven migration + retire server key. ✅ *Phase 2c* — passkey **enrollment + PRF unlock/lock UI** (`ui/src/components/crypto/e2ee-flow.js` + `PasskeyVaultGate.vue`, flag-gated): first-enroll generates the DEK + recovery key and PUTs the §5B record, additional passkeys re-wrap the DEK, unlock/recovery paths drive `vaultSession.unlock`; idle auto-lock becomes a soft lock; WebAuthn injected for unit tests (194 Vitest, flag-on headless smoke). Blue-green alternative for 2b/2c testing + cutover: [`design/blue-green-rebuild.md`](design/blue-green-rebuild.md). |

**Recommended offline path:** OFF-1 is essentially free (tidy it up). Don't chase
OFF-2/OFF-3 directly — they're a trap without OFF-4. If offline access matters to
the family, treat **OFF-4 (client-side E2EE)** as the real project; OFF-2 then
becomes a straightforward IndexedDB cache of encrypted blobs, and OFF-3 an
optional follow-up. If offline *isn't* a real need, skip the whole theme and keep
decryption server-side — simpler and arguably safer for a small shared vault.

## Theme 9 — Deployment & CI/CD

Infrastructure is provisioned by Task/Terraform, while code deployment runs in
GitHub Actions with OIDC (no stored cloud secrets). The API runs on Azure Functions
Flex Consumption so deployment uses the Azure Functions deploy action instead of
hand-rolled storage package uploads.

| ID | Pri | Effort | Item |
|----|-----|--------|------|
| CD-1 | **P1** | M | ✅ **Done.** **CI on every PR.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR + push to `main`: API `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` (net10, `passwordapp.api.tests`), migration-tool build, UI `npm install` + `lint` + `test:unit` + `build`, and `terraform fmt -check` + `validate`. Supersedes `EN-3`. (`npm ci` pending a committed lockfile.) |
| CD-3 | **P1** | S | ✅ **Done (code; operator wires the federated credential + secrets).** **Azure login via OIDC.** Both `infra.yml` and `deploy.yml` authenticate with `azure/login@v2` using `id-token: write` + `AZURE_CLIENT_ID/TENANT_ID/SUBSCRIPTION_ID` — no SP password or publish profile is stored. Terraform backend uses `ARM_USE_OIDC`. Setup runbook in [`deploy.md`](deploy.md). |
| CD-2 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done (code; operator approves each run).** **CD pipelines.** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploys API (Azure Functions action to Flex Consumption), UI (SWA CLI), and the Python maintenance function — on `workflow_dispatch` (per-component) or merge to `main`. Every job runs in the `production` Environment so it waits for approval. |
| CD-4 | P2 | M | ✅ **Done (code; operator runs the one-time state migration + Environment).** **Terraform in CI with remote state.** State moved to the `azurerm` backend (`providers.tf`, `use_oidc`). `.github/workflows/infra.yml` runs `task plan` on PRs touching `infrastructure/**` and `task apply` on `main` behind the `production` Environment approval. See [ADR-0007](adr/0007-oidc-cd-remote-state.md). |
| CD-5 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Encryption key/IV off the command line.** Both vars are `sensitive` in `variables.tf`; the Taskfile passes them via `TF_VAR_*` env (not `-var`), so they stay out of `ps`/shell history. (Goes away entirely once `OFF-4` retires the server key.) |
| CD-6 | P2 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Dependabot config** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) for nuget (api/tests/tools), npm (UI), pip (maintenance), terraform (root + maintenance), and github-actions — weekly, grouped. |
| CD-7 | P3 | S | ✅ **Done.** **Clear infra/deploy split.** `Taskfile.yaml` is the local/operator entrypoint for infrastructure and setup; `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` owns code deployment directly so local machines no longer need deployment packaging tools. |
| OFF-5 | P2 | M | 📋 **Planned (owner-managed infra).** **Cutover runbook.** The new-stack Terraform is owner-managed in the single `infrastructure/` directory (`VaultKeys` container + `E2EE_ENABLED`/`app_e2ee_enabled` already present; flip the flag + point at the new datastore there — no separate TF tree). Cutover: stand up the new stack → run `MIG-4` import → test E2EE (`OFF-4` 2b/2c) → brief write-freeze → fresh `backup` + full re-import → `MIG-5` parity → flip the SWA/DNS URL → keep old URL live as instant rollback. **RP ID is locked to the registrable parent (`denicolafamily.com`)** so passkeys survive the switch. Design: [`design/blue-green-rebuild.md`](design/blue-green-rebuild.md) §5, §8. |
